📦 **FrenzyFront Patch Notes - v0.07**

✈️ **New Unit: Transporter**

- **Airport**: Build airports to deploy Transporters (1 min rebuild time after each launch)
- **Transporter**: Flying unit that carries troops across land to enemy territory
  → Select an enemy territory to deploy - Transporter flies there automatically
  → Carries troops based on your total population (more troops = bigger army)
  → When it lands, it spawns a **Mini HQ** and captures surrounding territory
- **Mini HQ**: Temporary base that captures territory and prevents annexation
  → Territory containing HQ or Mini HQ cannot be surrounded and annexed
  → Mini HQ decays over time but buys crucial time for reinforcements

🛡️ **Annexation Protection**

- Territory containing your HQ or Mini HQ can no longer be annexed (surrounded and captured)
- This protects your base from being cut off and instantly lost

🎮 **Lobby Fix**

- Prevents issues when rapidly clicking Start before fully connected

📖 **Help Modal Updates**
